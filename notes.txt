McLennan idea:
projects are rewarded for
	- creating interesting news stories
and maybe also for
	- contributing power themselves

Use HUBzero to create the site?

How to allocate hosts to projects/apps
	each project has a share S(P) (assigned by S@h)
	each user assigns a share S(A) to area
	
--------------

database
	use a standard BOINC DB
		user
		host
	additional tables:
		area
		project
		app
		attachment
			userid
			area
			fraction

acct mgr RPC handler
	attach host to all projects w/ an app in selected area
	set project preferences to allow only apps in selected area
	RS(P) = 0
	for each area A
		for each P associated with A
			RS(P) += S(A)*S(P)

Need a way to gracefully detach projects
	(finish existing work, then detach)
