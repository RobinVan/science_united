====================
Allocation
--------------
The way in which computing power is divided among projects and users.
"Hard allocation": one that guaranteed, based on assumptions
about volunteer pool.
--------------
goals: multi-objective
    honor hard allocations
    respect soft allocations
    respect user prefs
    maximize throughput
--------------    
We can estimate the total throughput of the system,
   and we can break it down by resource type,
   and for a given set of keywords we can see how much is not vetoed.

Goal: someone comes to SU with an allocation request, which includes
- the available app version types
    (CPU, NVIDIA, AMD, platform, VM)
- the set of keywords
- # FLOPs
We can tell them whether this can be granted, and if so starting when

Parameters:
- what % of resources to use for allocations (50?)
- max % for a single allocation (10?)

Projects also get an unallocated share,
with a fraction determined by the popularity of their keywords

to process an allocation request:
select hosts that aren't ruled out by keywords
total their flops for eligible resources
------------
SU serves as a scheduler at the level of project.
It keeps track of targets, allocations, balances, host assignments.
SU allocation is at the granularity of project.
If a project needs app- or user-level granularity it can either
    - run multiple BOINC projects, 1 per user/app
    - use BOINC's built-in allocation system

An "allocation" consists of
- an initial balance
- the rate of balance accrual
- the interval of balance accrual
where "balance" is in terms of FLOPs

There are two measures of work done:
1) REC, as reported directly by clients
2) credit, as reported by projects

2) is cheat-resistant, 1) is not
1) is up-to-date, 2) is not (long jobs, validation delay)

Approach:
use 1) from SU scheduling, but don't show it to volunteers
(eliminate incentive for cheating)

show 2) to volunteers.

?? what if SU assigns a host to a project, and the project doesn't have work?
	SU should work in a reasonable way for sporadic workloads
    BOINC client:
    if devices are idle, and scheduler RPC returns nothing
    do an AM RPC, but only every so often
    (min AM RPC interval?)
Need way for SU to check if project has work?
--------------
gives projects more allocation if they supply computing?
    No.  nanoHub users are going to attach to nanoHub, not SU

========================================
Accounting
goals:
maintain daily history for
	total:
		CPU flops delta and total
		GPU flops delta and total
		CPU time delta and total
		GPU time delta and total
		# active hosts
		# active hosts w/ usable GPU
		# active users
		# jobs success
		# jobs fail
	project:
		CPU flops delta and total
		GPU flops delta and total
		CPU time delta and total
		GPU time delta and total
		# jobs success
		# jobs fail
	user:
		CPU flops delta and total
		GPU flops delta and total
		CPU time delta and total
		GPU time delta and total
		# jobs success
		# jobs fail

maintain per host (no history)
	CPU flops total
	CPU time total
	GPU flops total
	GPU time total
	has usable GPU
	# jobs success
	# jobs fail
	p_vm_extensions_disabled
		(should add this to standard code)

client changes:
	maintain
		per project
			total CPU and GPU time
			total CPU and GPU flops
				(take CPU throttling into account)
			# jobs success, fail
	report these in AM RPC
	report has usable GPU

Note: for convenience, flops is always measured in EC units

AM RPC handler
	compute deltas (relative to host record)
	sanity-check deltas
		time: #instances x dt
		flops: same, times fastest possible device (100 GFLOPS *256 CPU, 100 TFLOPS*8 GPU)
	update host record
	create accounting_user record if none
	atomically update delta, total fields of most recent account records for total, project, host

daily accounting program
	create new records for total, project, user
		new.delta = 0
		new.total = old.total + old.delta
	for total:
		compute # active hosts based on last RPC time
		group by userid to get # active users
		update # hosts w/ usable GPU
--------------
How to avoid accounting pre-SU EC?
invariant: when a host attaches to a project, totals start at zero

host_project has 2 sets of accounting:
    client_last_*   last value reported by client
        this may reset to zero if we detach/reattach the project
    total_*
        sum of deltas so far

First RPC:
    create host_project for all reported projects.
    set client_last_*; no deltas

All RPCs:
    if we send a project not currently reported
        if it has a host_project
            set client_last_* to zero
        else
            create a host_project, all zeros
    set "requested" for projects we're sending
    set "active" for these plus projects reported by client

new items
    would be good to show news items from project
    easiest way: each project exports RSS feed
    news items are tagged with keywords

    show combined stream to others

    Give projects more allocation if they supply news?
forums
    for discussion of projects, keywords?
==================
RPC handler

when are accounts created?
on initial registration:
    pick N best projects based on prefs
        (same logic as in RPC handler)
    start account creation for those projects
on RPC:
    pick N best projects
    if not registered with any of them
        return highest-score project we are registered with
==================
client changes

represent user keyword sets as two vector<int>s

The following have keyword sets:
AM_ACCOUNT

Scheduler request: include

Eventually (to show keywords in GUI),
client needs to have master keyword list (keywords.xml)
    bundle with installer;
    refresh every 2 weeks;
    refresh if see unknown keyword ID
The following have keyword sets:
PROJECT
WORKUNIT

==================
server changes
workunit table has keywords as varchar 256
WU_RESULT has keywords as string
scheduler: maintain array of vector<int> corresponding to cache
    if look at job, keywords nonempty, vector empty: parse
    when remove from cache, clear vector

remote job submission:
batch can have keywords
each job in batch can have keywords

local job submission:
create_work takes kw ids
    (multi-job as well as single)
==================
keyword-based scheduling

submission: batch has keywords
copied to results (new DB field, 256 chars)

each volunteer reports yes/no keywords in sched request
	(AM can supply "project opaque" text, passed to projects)

score-based scheduling:
	"no" keyword match returns -1
	"yes" match adds 1

ensure non-starvation of jobs in cache
	add job age to score

Project keywords include a fraction flag
	(estimate fraction of work from that project with that keyword).
	100 means all work from project will have that keyword

If a user has a "no" keyword matching a project "all" keyword,
don't attach to that project.

Can compute:
	- the fraction of work from project that user can do
	- the fraction of work from project that user wants to do
==================
Project plan
- web site for register and prefs

- admin web interface for editing projects, apps, keywords, quotas

- RPC stubs for account creation, setting prefs

- integrated client download

Overview
    SU targets a different population than the current BOINC user base:
        largely young (20s, 30s)
        ~half female
        primary motivation: science goals
        non-motivation: competition
            show user their own participation level over time
            no comparisons, leader boards
        science-oriented
        non-technical
            don't use words like FLOPS, CPU, or GPU
            OK: computer, job
    Simplicity
        hide information; TMI is a turn-off for target users
        hide features
    Graphical rather than textual display
    Keep the notion of "project" in the background.
    SU vs BOINC
        Ideally, we'd like an SU_branded version of BOINC.
        But until then, we explain that BOINC is software used by SU

instructions for alpha testers

Design doc
==================
testing and roll-out plan

- get scienceunited.berkeley.edu, su.berkeley.edu; get SSL working

- make 7.9 for win/mac;
    project list includes SU and boinc test

- announce SU to alpha testers; start testing

When SU is stable:
add SU to project list, non-test
fork/test/release 7.10

project stuff

Github
    learn project interface

communication channels

---------------------------

project app version info

need to know whether a host
a) can do work for a project at all
b) can use its GPU (s) for the project

where to store project AV info?

digest projects.xml and for each project produce a list of triples
(platform, GPU type, vbox flag)

store these either in JSON, XML, or serialize

function host_project_compatible() returns whether
    - host can do work for project at all
    - it can do work w/ vbox
    - it can do work using a GPU
-------------------
notion of backup project

Send 1-2 extra projects w/ zero resource share as backups,
in case higher-score project has no work, is down,
doesn't work for this host, etc.

More generally: we should notice if a host can't get work done
for a particular project, and treat it differently.
===========
New allocation model

share/total share = fraction of total FLOPS this project gets
balance = FLOPs owed to this project

daily accounting:
    x = total FLOPS in last day
    for each project p
        p.balance += x*(p.share/total_share)
        record balance, share in project accounting record

RPC
    for each project p
        p.balance -= reported EC

projected balance
    The idea is that there will be a ~24 period from
    when we start attaching a project to when
    the first reports of EC come in, and its balance declines.
    During that period we might over-attach it.

    So we could maintain a separate "projected balance",
    reset periodically to the balance,
    and decremented each time we attach the project by,
    say, half the estimated EC over the next day

    I'm not sure we need this; let's not do it for now.
