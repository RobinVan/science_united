keyword-based scheduling

submission: batch has keywords
copied to results (new DB field, 256 chars)

each volunteer reports yes/no keywords in sched request
	(AM can supply "project opaque" text, passed to projects)

score-based scheduling:
	"no" keyword match returns -1
	"yes" match adds 1

ensure non-starvation of jobs in cache
	add job age to score

Project keywords include a fraction flag
	(estimate fraction of work from that project with that keyword).
	100 means all work from project will have that keyword

If a user has a "no" keyword matching a project "all" keyword,
don't attach to that project.

Can compute:
	- the fraction of work from project that user can do
	- the fraction of work from project that user wants to do

-------------
random issue:
if a new keyword is added, should users be defaulted to no or maybe?
