- How do volunteers express
	- area prefs:
		want to compute for
		willing to compute for
		don't want to compute for
- How do projects express the properties of
	themselves
	their apps
	their jobs
- what is the granularity?
	project (but it could have mix of jobs)
	app (but it could have a mix of jobs)
	job?

	in the latter two cases, how does the top-level allocater
	(the account manager) know how much computing was done
	for each attribute?
------------
Assumption:

Selection/allocation policy is only within the acct mgr, not projects.
I.e. the scheduler on a project doesn't see user science prefs.
This means that we're not going to tag individual jobs or batches
with properties and have the scheduler match-make.
