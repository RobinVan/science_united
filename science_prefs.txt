- How do volunteers express
	- area prefs:
		want to compute for
		willing to compute for
		don't want to compute for
- How do projects express the properties of
	themselves
	their apps
	their jobs
- what is the granularity?
	project (but it could have mix of jobs)
	app (but it could have a mix of jobs)
	job?

	in the latter two cases, how does the top-level allocater
	(the account manager) know how much computing was done
	for each attribute?
------------
Assumption:

Selection/allocation policy is only within the acct mgr, not projects.
I.e. the scheduler on a project doesn't see user science prefs.
This means that we're not going to tag individual jobs or batches
with properties and have the scheduler match-make.

	biology
		medicine
			cancer
			ebola

hierarchy versus keywords
	some keywords are relevant only in certain contexts

Continents
	Asia, Europe

Institutions
	universities
	research labs

Projects
----------
Keywords
    area:astronomy area:physics
    country:us continent:north_america
    institution:university_of_illinois
    open_results:yes
    for_profit:no
    etc.
--------------
each project and application can have associated keywords

Each user has 2 lists of keywords: wanted and vetoed.
Vetoed: if matches any of project/app, don't run it.
Wanted: prioritize based on number of matches.

If a new keyword is added, it's automatically allowed
(neither wanted nor vetoed) for all users.
--------------
Science prefs
default: no restrictions

Science area
top level: green checkbox or red X next to each area
Can have "more detail..." or "you have specified more detail..."
