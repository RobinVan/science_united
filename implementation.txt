Need a way to find out how much work has been done by a host for an app
approaches:
    1) track it in the client, report in AM RPC
    2) get it from the project

1) seems preferable; will need a new client
--------------
database

use a standard BOINC DB
    user
    host
    message boards

need to add GPU peak flops to host table

additional tables:

keyword
    id
    name
    category
        science area, geographical area

project
    name
    description
    master url
    keywords
    (accounting info TBD)

project_keywords
    keyword_id
    project_id

user_keywords
    keyword_id
    user_id
    type
        prefer, avoid

account
    (describes a user account on a project)
    project_id
    user_id
    state (pending, created, bad passwd)
    n_tries

////// the following relevent once we have app resolution

project_app
    project_id
    keywords
    description of science, scientists
    (accounting info TBD)

project_app_keywords
    project_app

project_app_version
    project_app_id
    platform
    GPU; needed software
    need Vbox? need VM accel?

app_attachment
    project_app_id

///// other

news/discussion
    message board for each project, each app

NOTE: ideally we'd want attachment at the level of app version,
    or an indication of what resources to use.
    E.g. we might want to attach a project or app, but only w/ GPU

The set of keywords could be represented by a JSON file

--------------
acct mgr RPC handler
	attach host to all projects w/ an app in selected area
	set project preferences to allow only apps in selected area
	RS(P) = 0
	for each area A
		for each P associated with A
			RS(P) += S(A)*S(P)

Need a way to gracefully detach projects
	(finish existing work, then detach)

-------------------
Stages

- web site for register and prefs

- admin web interface for editing projects, apps, keywords, quotas

- RPC stubs for account creation, setting prefs

- integrated client download
