Need a way to find out how much work has been done by a host for an app
approaches:
    1) track it in the client, report in AM RPC
    2) get it from the project

1) seems preferable; will need a new client
--------------
database

use a standard BOINC DB
    user
    host
    message boards

additional tables:
project
    keywords
app
    link to project
    keywords
    description of science, scientists
app version
    link to app
    platform
    GPU; needed software
    need Vbox? need VM accel?
allocation
    app
    flops
news/discussion
    message board for each project, each app

The set of keywords can be represented by a JSON file

--------------
acct mgr RPC handler
	attach host to all projects w/ an app in selected area
	set project preferences to allow only apps in selected area
	RS(P) = 0
	for each area A
		for each P associated with A
			RS(P) += S(A)*S(P)

Need a way to gracefully detach projects
	(finish existing work, then detach)
