Science United is a new way for computer owners to participate in BOINC.
It lets users choose the science areas they want to support -
areas like biomedicine, physics, astronomy, and climate study.
Science United then allocates the user's computing power
among the BOINC projects doing research in those areas - including new projects.

This solves several problems that have limited the adoption of volunteer computing.
First, volunteers no longer have to study and evaluate 40 different projects.
Second, scientists no longer have to publicize their project,
or even create a web site, in order to attract volunteers.
Finally, it creates the possibility that a propective project can be guaranteed
a certain level of computing power ahead of time,
thus reducing the risk in creating a project.
